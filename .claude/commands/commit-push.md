description: Automatically stage, commit, and push changes to the remote repository
---

Please help me commit and push my changes to the remote repository. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to show the current state of the repository
2. Stage all changes using `git add .`
3. Create a meaningful commit message based on the changes shown in `git diff --staged`
4. Commit the changes with the generated message
5. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push`

If there are any issues (like no remote configured, merge conflicts, or authentication problems), explain what needs to be fixed and ask for guidance.

Make sure to follow the standard git commit message format with a clear, concise summary.
