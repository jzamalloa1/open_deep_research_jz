description: Stage and commit changes with an auto-generated commit message
---

Please help me commit my changes to the git repository. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to show the current state of the repository
2. Stage all changes using `git add .`
3. Analyze the staged changes using `git diff --staged`
4. Create a meaningful, concise commit message based on the changes
5. Commit the changes with the generated message

If there are any issues, explain what needs to be fixed and ask for guidance.

Do NOT push the changes to the remote repository unless I explicitly ask you to.
